ds106 Assignment Bank Wordpress Theme
=========================

ABOUT
-----
This Wordpress Theme allows you to create and customize a site that has all of the functionality of the [DS106 Open Assignment Bank](http://assignments.ds106.us/), to build a collection site of any collection of assignments, tasks etc. Generically I call them "Things" though internally you will find code references to "assignments". 

You can find a live demo running at http://bank.ds106.us/

The idea is a site where categories of things are created; within them are things to do as assignments. So we might have a site of "Challenges", and within there you might groups of Cooking Challenges, Fitness Challenges (think of them as categories). Within each are specific challenges to do, like "Make Bread From Scratch" "Cook Ham Bone Soup", or "Do 100 Pushups"). You can allows site visitors to add their own challenges via a web form. 

For each challenge, you can set up a site to allow people to submit their responses to a challenge via a web form, or if part of an ongoing activity or community, to aggregate them in from external blogs.

The ds106 Assignment Bank Theme is build as a child theme of the [Wordpress Bootstrap Theme[(http://320press.com) chosen for its responsive layout and flexible grid display.

Hopefully it is flexible to meet many use cases. The design allows you to create a site where the front of the site is the menu of types of things, but that could also be an internal page, and a normal blog flow can be front and center. The theme does not create any of the navigation menus for you, but you will find suggestions as to the types of things you can make available via the built in Wordpress menu editor.
